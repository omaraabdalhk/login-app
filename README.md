- View your account information
- Sign out when finished

## Form Validation

### Registration Validation
- First and last names must be at least 2 characters
- Email must be in valid format
- Password must be at least 8 characters with:
  - One uppercase letter
  - One lowercase letter
  - One number
- Passwords must match

### Login Validation
- Email is required and must be valid
- Password is required and must be at least 6 characters

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `src/App.css` for component-specific styles
- Modify `src/index.css` for global styles
- The app uses a modern gradient background and card-based design

### Functionality
- Add real API endpoints in the form submission handlers
- Implement persistent authentication with localStorage or cookies
- Add more user profile fields as needed

## Demo Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use any valid email format and password that meets the requirements:

- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `Password123`

## Security Notes

This is a demo application. In production, you should:

- Implement proper backend authentication
- Use HTTPS
- Hash passwords securely
- Implement JWT or session-based authentication
- Add rate limiting
- Validate inputs on the server side

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in package.json or kill the process using port 3000
2. **Dependencies not found**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
3. **Build errors**: Ensure you have the correct Node.js version

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version
